Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
 - Artemis Financial wanted to protect their organization from external threats by ensuring all security vulnerabilities are patched. Artemis Financial is a banking company who has clients all around the world. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
 - I was able to find the security vulnerabilities in the program I was given. The importance of coding securely is that it helps protect user information and protects the company from any loss of data or revenue. Having a strong software security helps ensure uptime and confidentiality of systems.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
 - At first it was difficult to read the vulnerability assessment from Maven as I had never seen it before. But after understanding how it was formatted I was able to read it and understand what vulnerabilities it was showing.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
 - I increased layers of security by ensuring the program was up to date on it's security software and ensured the program utilized a good encryption standard. Using SHA-256 was I believe the best choice as it gave adequate encryption procedures.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
 - To ensure I did not add new vulnerabilities, I reran the Maven dependency checker and compared it with the original to ensure there were no new vulnerabilities added.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
 - I found our textbook to be helpful and will most likely go through it again.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
 - I would most likely show them the full assignment as it shows a lot into my thinking and how I handle software security.
